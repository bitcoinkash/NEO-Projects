# NeoHub Proposal Inquiry

**Howdy team! I've noticed this is the second proposal you've put forth for GrantShares! Now I'm very curious as to what about the Neo blockchain has caught your eye and intrigued the team?**

Neo's exceptional suite of native tools empowers developers to craft sophisticated DApps. Its user-centric approach, from streamlined UX/DX systems to decentralized storage and identity solutions, sets it apart. This uniqueness is pivotal as blockchain applications grow intricate. Neo's open environment, regardless of coding preference, makes it the most adaptable platform.

**As a part of this proposal I'm interested in hearing more about the types of templates the team intends to create? Also, are there examples of similar types of projects the NeoHub will replicate? Has the team built any dApps or written smart contracts on Neo?**

We actually had a GitHub repository of sorts that we had started development on. The idea was to create tutorials and templates people could use to develop in Rust, Motoko, Solidity, among other languages. The project was put on pause as we had issues with a previous partner who was working on it. This is a project we would really like to get off the ground.

**Is the NeoHub team submitting similar types of proposals for grants in other blockchain ecosystems?**

We are not submitting this type of grant to any other blockchain.

**Regarding the "Branding for NEO" section: where can we verify these statistics? What Twitter account are you referring to? I took a peek at the Hedge Kitten Twitter account and there are only 17 followers, and there hasn't been activity on the account since 2020.**

The followers we have are coming from SydTek and Women in Blockchain Canada. HedgeKitten Twitter was created to secure the name, as we have developed our own AI for trading financial markets.
