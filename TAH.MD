# TokenAuctionHouse Proposal Review

**Hello to the TokenAuctionHouse team and thanks for taking the time to submit this proposal. To start the conversation off, I'm curious about why the team chose the Neo blockchain to build on top of. Are you also applying for grants to other blockchain ecosystems? Will TAH be cross-chain?**

We have been building on various chains for a while now, and as we delve deeper, we get more and more interested in blockchain technology. We love NEO and are looking at building several projects on NEO. TAH will be cross-chain as we want to support as many chains as possible.

**The proposal mentions that Neo lacks a dedicated platform for NEO-based NFT transactions and community engagement. In which ways do you believe that TAH will provide services that GhostMarket, Mega Oasis, or SkyHut aren't delivering**?

TAH marketplace aims to complement offerings, by SkyHut, GhostMarket and Mega Oasis, on Neo by leveraging on community engagement and advanced analytics. TAH envisions a vibrant community hub with forums, allowing artists and collectors to connect with and collaborate. As we grow, TAH's analytics tools will provide data-driven insights for pricing and marketing decisions. Through these distinctive features, TAH aims to enhance the Neo NFT ecosystem by offering a comprehensive and user-centered marketplace experience.

**Will the platform leverage the NeoFS distributed storage network for image hosting? If this solution doesn't use NeoFS, I think it will have a hard time garnering support from other voting members.**

Yes, we will use NeoFS for image storage. We also have a ticketing system for a VR streaming platform which would work well with NeoFS. [JoiniFeel](https://joinifeel.com) is our other project.

**Regarding the integrated news aggregator, what sources of news will you be sharing on the platform? Will they be protocol-agnostic, or Neo-centric? What are the news sources you plan on sharing with TAH users?**

We plan on creating something that allows users to choose the chain they want to read news about, although we are going to focus on NEO to get us started.

This iteration of TAH seems like it will be the first NFT marketplace the team has built. How can the GrantShares voting members be confident that the team will be able to deliver? I tried to go to the website and was met with a 403 error.

We have set milestones in place already and have plans to keep voting members informed on our progress via a WordPress blog we will set up. This should allow all parties interested in T
